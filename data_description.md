> So I'm sending you a link for Raleigh for 2013 and 2014. These are the stations we turned up a few years back ( http://politicaladsleuth.com/political-files/stations/dma/560/ ) Not all of them have ads actually airing. Other thing I should mention is that until July of 2014 the stations that are listed as not mandated didn't have to report, though some started filing voluntarily a bit ahead of time.

> The zipped file is, uh, 1.8 gigs or so and is here: http://politicaladsleuth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/raleigh_1314.zip

> The pdf file names are a pain so I've transformed them into the 14 digit ids that FEC includes as part of the title (they are included in the original uploaded file names); the new file names are in the pdf_location column. (There are actually two versions of every file in the FCC's station, one before it gets processed and one after, but I'm just grabbing one version of each). There's a full listing of the files, including the original location, and whatever I could get from pdfinfo in the manifest files--which are [station_callsign].csv. CreationData is the file creation time from pdfinfo while upload_time is the time it was posted to the FCC's site.

> The files I'm sending are what's on the servers now--the FCC allows people to remove files, alter them, etc., but most edits actually improve accuracy. Am assuming this is not something yr overly concerned about...
